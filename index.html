                The fast fashion industry is notorious for its substantial environmental footprint and linked-excessive labor practices. 
                We are in a climate crisis that is caused by our consumption habits and overspending on brands and companies that do not take into consideration the environment or sustainable actions.

                                <p>Instead of going for the cheapest option when browsing through online websites for clothes adopt responsible consumption habits like the five R's: 
                                    1. Refuse: Learn to say 'No' to purchase impulses.
                                    2. Reduce: Adopt a lean mindset on the amount you buy and the size of your closet
                                    3. Reuse: Learn to wear a clothing until the very end of its lifetime, and even if they become unwearable turn them into other objects, toys, quilts, etc.
                                    4. Repair: Stitching and sewing is always a good option to avoid throwing away a piece that just has minor damages.
                                    5. Recycle: There are platforms now that are strictly for selling old clothes that you could take advantage of.</p>

                                    Materials like organic bamboo linen, hemp, or recycled cotton are a few alternatives to the toxic materials often found in fast-fashion garments.</p>

                                <p>Emma is a 25 year old Business Management Student at University of Mauritius. She was fed up of seeing landfills next to her home with piles of clothes being trashed literally every month. 
                                        So, as a way to fight back against this phenomenon she decided that she would take actions in her own hands and created a platform via social media application, Instagram to start selling old clothes.
                                        She does not just sell her own clothes but also encourages her friends to create their own page to sell their clothes online. At the same time this can generate money for them, but also sensitize people on the benefits of thrifting and the circular economy.</p>
